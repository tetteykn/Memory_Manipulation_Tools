# **Memory Bytes Scanner**  

The **Memory Bytes Scanner** is a straightforward tool designed to assist users in generating unique byte sequences for their processes. It features a scanning capability that supports wild-card searches, allowing users to search for byte patterns in the following format:

For example, a search pattern such as:  
`4F ? 74 05 ? 49 0F CE 49 C1 C6 ? 66`  
follows the **Auto Assembly format**, enabling seamless copying and pasting for advanced memory manipulation.  

## **Key Features**  

- **Wild-Card Search Capability**: The tool allows for flexible searching by accommodating wild-card characters.
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Option to automatically cancel the search if duplicate byte sequences are detected.  
- **Process ID Scanning**: The scanner can search across all process IDs or be restricted to a specific ID as per user preference.
- **Absolute Address Identification**: Displays the precise memory address where the byte sequence is found.  
- **Module Name and Base Address Information**: Users are presented with the module name and the base address corresponding to the absolute address of the found byte sequence. 
- **Memory Region Details**: Displays the size of the memory region where the byte sequence is located.  

This tool simplifies the process of locating unique byte patterns in memory, making it useful for debugging, Creating cheats, and various memory analysis tasks.
